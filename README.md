# TOP-Calculator
The final project assignment of TOP's Foundations Course.

Here, a functional calculator was to be produced. 
HTML and CSS were to be used to generate a realistic UI for the calculator.
JS was to be used to create functions for the four numeric operators.
JS was to be used to call these functions when the associated buttons are pressed.

As the final project assignment of the Foundations Course, this project showcases the summation of my learning and skills development with HTML, CSS and JS at the time of course completion (14th Jan 2023).
